"""
In this module, We implement def-use chain structure for Scalpel framework. A def-use chain is a data structure that consists of a definition of a variable and all the uses of that variable.
A def-use chain is a step in liveness analysis, so that logical representations of all the variables can be identified and tracked through the code.
